A work in progress Base Builder game, in the style of games like Rimworld and Dwarf Fortress, made in the Unity game engine with C#. Uses the A* Pathfinding Algorithm.

This was done primarily as a learning experience to better learn how to structure a large-scale project. I used a lot of guides to develop this, including guides on how to implement complex systems like the A* Pathfinding Algorithm.
